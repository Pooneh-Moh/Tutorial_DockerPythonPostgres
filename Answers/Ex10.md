# Goal: to design an algorithm to solve deadlocks in a way such the overall computation of the system does not globally halt and terminates soon or later.

## 1. Weather the proposed detection algo is halting-unsafe? 
The Algo has 3 main steps:

1. **Lock Acquisition and Waiting**: The first two bullet points. The algorithm enforces a waiting mechanism when a DBMS process attempts to acquire a lock on a row that is already locked by another transaction. This ensures that a transaction will wait until the owning transaction completes and releases the lock.

2. **Lock Release and Selection of Waiting Process**: The other two steps. When a transaction completes, the associated lock on a row is released, and one of the waiting processes is selected randomly to continue its execution. This helps avoid a single process continuously holding a lock and starving other processes.

3. **Deadlock Detection and Termination**: In the case of a deadlock, the detection algorithm terminates one of the processes contributing to the deadlock. This termination is random and can be seen as a way to break the deadlock cycle.

Let's check the case with multiple clients (>= 2)

- **Client A**: Acquires Lock on Row 1
- **Client B**: Acquires Lock on Row 2

Suppose Client A and Client B both have some tasks that require modifying the rows they have locked. If one of the clients completes its transaction and releases the lock, the other client can proceed. In this scenario, there is no deadlock, and the deadlock detection algorithm is not directly invoked. Therefore, the halting-unsafety property doesn't apply. (everything smooth)

Now, Clinet # = 3; Client A, Client B, and Client C:

- **Client A**: Acquires Lock on Row 1
- **Client B**: Acquires Lock on Row 2
- **Client C**: Tries to Acquire Lock on Row 1 (waits for Client A)

So, now clinet C is waiting for client A. --> deadlock algo function, and assign a random client. Let's say it terminat's action on client A. So, client C and proceed and client A's task in not complete. So this shows a halting-unsafety property. The detection algorithm can lead to the termination of a client's transaction, thereby preventing the entire set of clients from completing their computations successfully.

In  this simple example, we can understand that the deadlock algo is actually halting-unsafe. It can kead to scenarios where a sequence of client terminations prevents the entire set of clients from successfully completing their transactions.

## 2. Provide a workaround to make all the clients terminate and describe under which hypothesis it works (note: the solution must not prevent clients from competing for the acquisition of locks).

So, we have to look for some alternatives where we won't a case where all the client's have to terminate in certain senarios. This can be achieved by a priority based method. So, we can terminate a process based on a priority (which we assume it's fair). For example, instead of selecting a waiting process randomly, the algorithm will select the waiting process with the lowest priority (longest waiting time) to proceed. This prevents a process from being repeatedly terminated.

There exist two proposal in general to avoid the problem: 
- **Wait-Die Scheme:** In this scheme, If a transaction requests a resource that is locked by another transaction, then the DBMS simply checks the timestamp of both transactions and allows the older transaction to wait until the resource is available for execution. 
- **Wound Wait Scheme:** In this scheme, if an older transaction requests for a resource held by a younger transaction, then an older transaction forces a younger transaction to kill the transaction and release the resource.

## Explain whether PostgreSQL version 14 can be considered to have an HU-DDA and elaborate on the commands that might be affected by such problems. In yes, propose a simple solution to correct the behaviour of the DBMS.

At the current version of PostgreSQL (15), I think the documentation should be an indicator for the specefic commands. @[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html], @[https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Distributed_deadlock_detection]

PostgreSQL itself represents object-level lock with various internal functions mainly in lock.c. This is used to chase wait-for-graph when a transaction fails to acquire a lock within the timeframe defined by deadlock_timeout GUC parameter, implemented in deadlock.c.
We can extended this to represent status of transactions waiting for completion of remote transactions. @[https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Distributed_deadlock_detection]

PostgreSQL automatically detects deadlock situations and resolves them by aborting one of the transactions involved, allowing the other(s) to complete. (Exactly which transaction will be aborted is difficult to predict and should not be relied upon.) @[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html]

In the documentation of version 14, I found this:
- In '''pg_dump''', avoid calling unsafe server functions before we have locks on the tables to be examined (Tom Lane, Gilles Darold)

pg_dump uses certain server functions that can fail if examining a table that gets dropped concurrently. Avoid this type of failure by ensuring that we obtain access share lock before inquiring too deeply into a table's properties, and that we don't apply such functions to tables we don't intend to dump at all. @[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14-7.html]

However, pg_dump itself is not directly related to the scenario of deadlock detection and resolution, it is an essential tool for managing and maintaining databases, including situations involving data recovery after a deadlock or other issues.

- Fix deadlock between DROP DATABASE and logical replication worker process (Hou Zhijie)

This was caused by an ill-advised choice to block interrupts while creating a logical replication slot in the worker. In version 15 that could lead to an undetected deadlock. In version 14, no deadlock has been observed, but it's still a bad idea to block interrupts while waiting for network I/O. @[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14-7.html]

But non of these are halting-unsafde behavior! Beacuse, PostgreSQL is designed to employ a priority-based approach for deadlock resolution that ensures fairness and prevents indefinite termination of client transactions.
