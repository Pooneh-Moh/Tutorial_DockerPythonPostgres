# Goal: to show whether SQL with Common Table Expressions, in terms of computational model, is expressive enough to compute a well-known important class of mathematical functions.

**What are primitive recursive function?**
So, let's first undertand whar are primitive recursive function? 
a function that can be computed by a computer program whose loops are all "for" loops! 
A primitive recursive function takes a fixed number of arguments, each a natural number (nonnegative integer: {0, 1, 2, ...}), and returns a natural number. If it takes n arguments it is called n-ary. @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function] :)

The basic building blocks for primitive recursive functions are:

1. Constant function: The function that maps all inputs to a constant value.
2. Successor function: The function that adds 1 to its input.
3. Projection function: These functions simply return one of their inputs without modification. For example, the projection function \(P_i^n(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = x_i\), where \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

The two operations used for constructing primitive recursive functions are:

1. Composition: If \(f_1, f_2, ..., f_n\) are primitive recursive functions, then their composition \(g(x_1, x_2, ..., x_m) = f_n(f_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_m), f_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_m), ..., f_n(x_1, x_2, ..., x_m))\) is also primitive recursive.
2. Primitive recursion: If \(f\) and \(g\) are primitive recursive functions, and \(h(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n+2})\) is a primitive recursive function, then the function defined by primitive recursion: \(h(0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\) and \(h(k+1, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = g(k, h(k, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\) is also primitive recursive.

Now that we undrestood the primitive recursive function, let's address the question:

1. **whether SQL with recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can simulate any primitive recursive function?:**
   It's possible to create these functions, beacuse we can use the primary operations of sql to emulate thr function. rimitive recursion can be implemented using recursive CTEs by defining the base case(s) and the recursive case(s). The base case represents the initial value of the function, and the recursive case computes the function's value based on the previous values

   multiple *Example* are presented in @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function]
   
   - Example of primitive recursio recursive CTEs is presented in @[https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/recursive-cte/]
  


4. **Computing the Function \(T(n)\):**
   The function \(T(n)\) have limit operations and various components. it's challenging to provide a specific SQL query to compute it using recursive CTEs. 

To summarize, SQL with recursive CTEs is capable of simulating primitive recursive functions and implementing primitive recursion. However, the complexity of simulating more complex functions heavily depends on the specific mathematical properties and operations involved in those functions.
